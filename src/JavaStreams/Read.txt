Streams: to process data in collection, streams are used

filter()=> used for filtering data and provide necessary data from original source. Always takes predicate and
return boolean
map()=> transforms the source data in stream and provides an entirely new set of data

flatmap()=> uused to process complex data, e.g. collection inside a collection

parallelstream()=> used to run the data in parallel streams to faster the process
