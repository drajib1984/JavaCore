Polymorphism:
means many forms :

Types of polymorphism:
1. Compile time polymorphism=> can bee achieved by method overloading, handled by compiler
2. Runtime polymorphism=> can be achieved bby method overriding, handled by JVM

                 Method Overloading                                  Method Overriding
           Same Class                                              Different Class
 Different arguments=> i. No. of arguments                 Different arguments=> i. No. of arguments
                       ii. Sequence of arguments                                ii. Sequence of arguments
                       iii.Type of arguments                                    iii.Type of arguments



Overloading: creating methods/constructor with same name but with different parameters & data types of parameters
Advantages: saves time & memory

This keyword: it is used to show the class variables when both class and method variables are same. Keeping the
same variable saves memory

Static methods: how to access?
i. static methods can only access static stuff directly w/o creating object
ii. static method can access non-static stuff thru object creation
iii. Non-static methods can access both static and non-static stuffs

Over riding:

Its doe thru inheritance and method name & variable should be same. Only the body or logic inside the method
should be changed in child class
