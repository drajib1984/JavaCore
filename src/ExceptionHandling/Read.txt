Exception is an abnormal condition, in java exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of the
program
Types of exception:
i. Checked exception : exceptions identified by the compiler, and can be handleed by try-catch block or throws
ii. Unchecked exception: exceptions that are not identified by the compiler

             Exception                                                    Error
1. happens because of programs                                     1. happens because of lack oof resources
2. Exceptions are recoverable, using try-catch                     2. Not recoverable
3. Two types=> checked & unchecked                                 3. One type => unchecked

Finally block is used to write the corrected programs or close the open files. Finally block will always be
executed even if there is exception or not

Throw keyword is used for custom exceptions/ user defined exception

Throws is used to declare an exception. It ggives information to caller meethod that there may occur an exception
so it is better for the caller method to provide an exception handling code so the normal flow can be maintained

                Throw                                                         Throws
1. Used to create an exception object manually                    1. Used to declare the exception
2. Used in runtime                                                2. used for compile time exception
3.Single exception                                                 3. Multiple exception
4.Used within method                                              4. Used with method signature
5. Followed by new instance                                        5. Followed by class
