Major entities of OOP
i. Class: collection of methods & variables. Class is a logical entity
ii. Object: physical entity that has variables and methods. Object is an instance of class
ii. Method: block of codee that contains logic

6 main pillars of OOP
i.Class    ii.Object & methods     iii.Inheritance     iv. Polymorphism    v.Inheritance   vi.Encapsulation

We can assign value to variable in 3 ways
- using reference variable
- using method
- using constructor

Differences between method & constructor

           Method                                         Constructor
1. Method name set up by developer  | 1. Constructor name must be same as class
 as per wish                        |
2.Method may or maynot return value |2.Constructor doesn't return value
3. Method needs to be called        |3.Automatically invoked during object creation
explicitly                          |
4. Used for writing logic           |4.Used for initializing value


Abstraction: process of hiding the internal implementation & just highlighting the set up services that we are
offering. A method without body is an abstract method

Two ways of achieving abstraction:
- By using abstract class
- By using interfaces

If the class is abstract, method must be declared as abstract. However, abstract method does not need to be in
abstract class

If a regular class extends an abstract class, then regular class must implement all the abstract methods of the
abstract parent class

               Abstraction                                             Encapsulation
1. Abstraction is details hiding                                1. Encapsulation is data hiding
2.Deals with exposing interface to user                         2.Grouping methods and data together
and hiding the details of implementation
